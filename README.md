## Building a Machine Learning API with Flask and Integrating it with an Express.js Application

**1. Creating a Flask API:**  
where we installed the pre-trained model, and created a route that post the request of the express endpoint to predict finally a classification of 'positive', 'negative' and 'neutral'.  

**2. Creating the express.js app:**  
in which the server is getting the user's request and sending it to the port of flask api to get a certain response ready to be delivered to the user interface.  

**3. Objective:**  
the objective of this little exercise is to build a simple Flask API that serves a machine learning model.
